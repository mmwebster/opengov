# OpenGov Sprint #1 Report
## 10 July 2017

## Actions to stop doing:
* Vague definitions of what peopleâ€™s jobs should be
* Should be explicitly defined so people know their exact job is 

## Actions to start doing:
* Submitting solo work to the group folder frequently
   * Allows for others to make adjustments to their codes appropriately
* More tangible smaller goals that can be easily defined and completed
   * Will help with sprint planning and knowing current progress
* Split up tasks into more individual required jobs
   * Removes ambiguity from assigning two people a job

## Actions to keep doing:
* Talking on slack about where we are in the project
   * In-person meeting and discussion about project design
* Very helpful and likely to still morph as jobs are completed and new information arises 
   * Keep learning ruby & other languages to accelerate programming abilities by sprint 3

## Work Completed
* Develop basic understanding of HTML interpretation and ruby syntax
* Create a simple scrapper than can pull data off of a website
* Setup PosgreSQL database

## Work Not Completed:
* Synchronization across components 
   * Each component is isolated current
   * Likely to incur issues when combining individual pieces together
   * Has made development/debugging of that isolated part easier though

## Work Completion rate: 
* Slow, due to a few reasons
   * Time taken to set up environments and programs
   * Time taken to learn new languages 
   * Started Sprint 1 late, so this was the shortest week
   * Midterms in this and other classes
* No burn-up chart because we did not have time to properly compose user stories for completion
   * Burn down charts viewable (in the future) at: https://tree.taiga.io/project/mmwebster-opengov/backlog
* Expect Sprint 2 to be the most explosive because we have everything needed finally!
